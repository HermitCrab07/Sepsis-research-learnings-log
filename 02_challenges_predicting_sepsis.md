# Challenges predicting sepsis

- Setup (import config)
- Defining “sepsis”: label ambiguity (SIRS vs Sepsis‑3, onset time)
- Data issues: missingness, irregular sampling, delayed charting
- Treatment leakage (labs ordered because patient is sick)
- Class imbalance / prevalence drift
- Lead time definitions (predict @6h? @12h?)
- External validity (site differences, LMIC transfer)
- Implications for modelling strategy
